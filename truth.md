## Some epistomological foundations

### What we mean by thoughts

*To propose a thought, all that is necessary is to write it down in words and to give the script to somebody who can read and understand the chosen language.*

*When a thought is expressed so that the choice of words appears irreplaceable by a better one, then the writer has written poetry.*

  -- Herbert Brun
  
So, thoughts are shared ideas.  To be valid, the thought needs merely to be expressed well.  Opposing thoughts do not necessarily invalidate each other.

In these writings we will propose thoughts and attempt to express them well.

### What we mean by "truth"

Forty odd years ago, I sat in [Herbert Brun's](http://www.herbertbrun.org/) upper level class in music theory.  He challenged us to propose examples of "truth" or "purity" in music.  For every example presented, he offerred an equally valid counter-example.

Truth is an unavaoidable concept, but frustratingly subtle and illusive.  A useful concept of truth will vary with the context.  In the case of music or art, Brun's point was you are wasting your time seeking absolutes and perhaps was reacting against those from a generation before him who claimed not only that absolutes exist but that they had found them. 

In pragmatic realms like finance, we are concerned with usefulness and whatever is useful can stake some claim to "truth".

When we look at the Wikipedia definition of "Truth", we see dozens of different ideas about what could be meant by truth.  While I'm not expert in philosophy, I will talk about a few of them.

Platonic forms are an absolute idea about truth that exist independent of human experience.  One can imagine a perfect square or triangle even though none exists in the physical world.

Logical truths are another kind of abstraction.  We usually learn math as a formal axiomatic system.  We establish a small set of axioms and derive everything else logically from the axiom.

Sense data can lead us to another idea about truth.  We can see, hear or otherwise sense things and based on that sense data consider what we observe to be true things.  

People who do finance have at times used all of these approaches to understanding "true" statements in their field.  

Overconfidence is common.  A vast majority of automobile drivers consider themselves better than average.  Finance is not immune from this.  We see lots of pronouncements in finance presented with too great a sense of definitiveness.  Finance is the study of human financial behavior with all its flaws and inconsistencies.  There are no platonic forms no absolute truths in finance.  There are, however, patterns.

Observing these patterns, we want to explain.  Finance emerged as a discipline in the mid 20th cewntury in the context of the neo-classical movement in economics.  This branch of economics is model oriented and includes the idea that consumers maximize "utility" in their consumption decisions subject to the constraints of a budget.  The theory was adapted to investment decisions.  

The problem was coming up with a working definition for cost in the optimization decision.   If there were no cost function to optimize against, then people would just concentrate their investments in assets with the higher expected returns.  And they clearly didn't do that.  So, volatility was proposed as the cost function in the sense that it was hypothesized that people would prefer to avoid volatility but would tolerate to varying extents based on their risk preferences in order to make more money with their investments.  Thus was born modern finance including modern portfolio theory, the capital asset pricing model and the efficient markets hypothesis.

This edifice is the prime example of a formal axiomatic system in finance.  It starts with an axiom that says that people are on average good utility maximizers relative to a cost function of volatility.  It adds assumptions of freely available information and low transaction costs.  It then applies mathematical logic to these and derives that the characteristics of markets that must necessarily follow.  These characteristics include efficiency in pricing and reasonable stability through self correction of market mechanism.  

Axiomatic systems are true by their internal consistency and, as such, modern finance is a beautiful achievement deserving of the multiple Nobel prizes awarded to its founders.  But is it useful?  

Here we must examine the theory in the context of observation.  Some of the most important implications of modern finance stand up to empirical tests.  In particular, liquid markets seem to be a random walk rapidly absorbing available information.  But other conclusions are less convincing.  "Efficiency" implies not only that markets rapidly absorb information but that they do so correctly resulting in prices consistent with intrinsic values.  If this is true, there are no bubbles.  Do we really believe that after the global financial crisis?

If we look for truth from observation only and abandon models, we develop a different set of problems.  Improbable things happen all the time and we have to be careful to place too much confidence in believing things we observe will happen again.  So, you need rigorous statistics and healthy skepticism of the repeatability of the things you observe.  It's also useful to have a theory of human behavior that is consistent with what you observe, if a trade seems propitious is there a logical explanation of why somebody else is on the other side of the trade?  But the theories of behaviour do not have to follow the neoclassical model which hypothesize hyper-rationality and competence, at least on average.  The modern (or maybe we should say post-modern) trend in finance is toward "empirical finance" which attempts to balance observation with models and allows for diversity in motivation and perspectives by segments of market participants.  Models in this framework may not be closed form and may consider suboptimal behaviors of the type now famously documented in the work Kahneman, Tversky, Shiller, Thaler and others. 

### The danger of dogma

One imagines that few things could be more confidence inducing than winning a Nobel prize.  And the Chicago school of finance for a time dominated this award. Modern portfolio theory became the *sine qua non* of sophistication in financial thinking and few questioned its foundations.  Long Term Capital Management was a highly levered hedge fund that operated on a model built from the same foundation as modern portfolio theory.  Core to its functioning was an assumption about the underlying stability of certain relationships that were exploited in their trading strategy.  Roger Lowenstein's **When Genius Failed** is a terrific book about what went wrong.  A decade later with the global financial crisis, Alan Greenspan famously testified to Congress that "the whole intellectually edifice" underlying the regulatory mechanisms of risk management had collapsed.  

Overconfidence can lead to dogma and dogma suppresses honest and skeptical evaluation.  If we are convinced swans are white, we explain away the black ones as anomalies.

### A proposition about truth in finance

In the context of finance, what we consider true is founded first and foremost in observation.  If we observe a pattern which is persistent enough to pass statistical tests, then we may form a belief about people's behavior in financial markets.  That behavior needs to make sense in the context of some sort of a model of behavior.  But the model doesn't have to be closed form or based in traditional mathematics.  So, a financial thought has potential for truth if it is well founded in observable facts confirmed by statistical analysis and consistent with a plausible model of human behavior.

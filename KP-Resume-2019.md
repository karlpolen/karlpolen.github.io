During Karl Polen's tenure at ASRS, he was instrumental in implementing substantial revisions to the investment approach.  Previously, the ASRS relied on public equities as the primary driver of returns.  The program was re-envisioned to migrate nearly 50% of the assets to private equity, real estate and credit.  The real estate and credit programs were implemented in separate accounts and direct investments resulting in superior returns and substantially reduced fees.  When appropriate, ASRS also invested in substantial stakes in asset managers providing services to ASRS to capitalize on the value created by fee streams paid to those managers and the growth in those fees enabled partly through affiliation with ASRS.  

A shown in the following charts extracted from a public ASRS board presentation, the combined effect of these programs led to substantial improvements in ASRS investment results and led to ASRS consistently ranking in the top quartile when compared to other large U.S. public pension plans.

# Figure and Ground

## Chaconne

 *Remember me*
 
 -- Dido
 
[Dido's Lament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-H--Z9UzQYE) closes Purcell's opera Dido and Aeneas.  Aeneas is blown off course and lands in Carthage where he meets Dido.  They fall in love but he must return to his homeland.  She is unconsolable.

If you took a class in music appreciation, you probably heard this aria as an example of *ciaccona*, in English sometimes referred to as figure and ground.  The bass line repeats itself unaltered and the melody is built around it.  

The bass line occurs in five bars of three beats.  The primary key of the piece never appears on the downbeat until the fifth bar.  The text is in a different meter that doesn't line up with the ground.  "Remember me" is the central message of the text.  It is repeated three times, each at a different point in the five bar ground and each with a different harmonic implication.

## Style

*The classical style appears inevitable only after the event.*
